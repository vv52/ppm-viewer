# Milestone #4 Reflection #

Overall, for all the attempts I took to find a different GUI, I did have a fun time working with FLTK. This final step has definitely taught me the most of any this semester; I learned how to balance tech debt and new implementation much better than I've been able to in the past. The most difficulty I had was with trying to solve the PPM vector subscript range error with seemingly random files (I did not end up figuring out what is wrong) and attempting to flesh out the included pixel class after deciding not to implement mine for ease of implementation.

I think this was a great assignment and it's one of the more enjoyable assignments I've ever had at any school. I would maybe suggest starting effects as classes sooner or potentially working with FLTK earlier in the semester, working around and with code one doesn't understand fully is fantastic practice for real world environments.
